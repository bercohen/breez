# README

The environment I used to create this site used:

* Ruby version 2.3.1

* Rails ruby 5.0.6

* I linked to Bootstrap 4.1.3 CDN in the layouts/application.html.erb

The application allows you to:

* Add products to carts and track the quantity of products and line items being added and removed

* Place Orders

* Update the quantity of items in an order so long as the order is not paid

* edit items prices so long as they are not in a cart
